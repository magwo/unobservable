# unobservable.js
Observable pattern implementation so fast it's almost unobservable.

Not really, but it's pretty fast. It highly prioritizes performance and low memory churn in runtime. The code sacrifices clarity and succinctness in order to get the best performance and memory churn possible.

That said, it is also very minimalistic and small.

It is inspired by riot.js and intends to be API compatible with it (riot.observable).
